# This is a placeholder for the login.png image
# In a real workshop, this would be a proper mockup image
# The image should show a simple login form with:
# - Title: "NBA App Login"
# - Username field
# - Password field  
# - Login button
# - "Remember me" checkbox
# - "Forgot password?" link
# For the workshop, instructors should replace this with an actual PNG mockup
